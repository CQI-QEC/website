Teams of four person registred in this category have twelve hours to produce a prototype that can respond to a problem that was presented the day of the competition. At the end of this marathon, these teams show the relevance of their solution by completing, in front of a public, the task asked with the help of their prototype. This competition is typicaly reserved to the students that have a minimum of 60 credits completed in their bachelor's degree.",

            "The junior design is, in a way, the little sister of the senior competition. The competition's concept remains the same one as the senior's design. The principal difference is the level of difficulty of the problem, which is lower than its counterpart. In general, the teams of four have eight hours to make a prototype. This competition is reserved to students with less than 60 credits completed in their bachelor's degree.",

            "One engineer cannot soly rely on their talents of manager and designer; He or she also needs to improve their communication skills as a way of efficiently develop in a world where we rely more and more on multidisciplinarity. The competition of debate competitions is based on this concept in order to place future engineers in the midst of oral clashes which will force them to show tact, eloquence and opinions. Here, the participants confront two by two by developing arguments on the go based on a position and a theme that are imposed to them.",

More and more, engineers are called to better and optimised products that surround us and that seems mundane. The re-engineering competition aims to test the capacity of the participants, paired in teams of two, to enhance existant products in order to respond to new constraints. The teams present their solution in front of a jury, allowing them to not only demonstrate their imagination and their technical knowledge, but also their communication talent.",

During this competition, the participants, paired in teams of four, have approximately six hours to propose a complete solution to a complex problem. Their solution then needs to be presented in front of a jury, thus leveraging their communication and persuasion talents.",

            "Often complex, the exercice of the functions of an engineer forces them to appeal to abstract and intagible concepts. It is crucial for the engineer to know how to popularize his or hers art clearly and precisly to be able to communicate his or hers knowledge. The scientific communication competition allows the participants, alone or by teams of two, to showcase their control of this art by explaining, clearly, a complex engineering subject. The presentations are evaluated in front of a jury.",
